# Folders
The 'code' folder has the raw code files. If you want to download and test it, you will need to install somethings on your computer (just do that if you already know how to use python and how to download and use different libraries).
The 'executable' folder have the executable file within it. You just need to download it and start using it (but first read the instructions in the 'instructions' folder).

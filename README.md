# Version 2.07
We changed the first screen presented, so now you can choose which block you want the procedure to start without needing to change the 'configData.json' file. We also changed how we are presenting the information in the 'configData.json' file (if you think its harder than it was before, please contact us).

# Version 2.08
We added a control for the volume in the 'configData.json' file, so you can change this according to your experiment. We have updated the sample stimulus presentation, now it's possible to add more than one sample stimulus (therefore, it's possible to add a contextual stimulus). And we have included an error code for helping with ocasional problems with the code. Finally, all descriptions of the variables in the code were changed to english.
